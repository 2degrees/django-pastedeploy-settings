Getting help
============

Keep in mind that **django-pastedeploy-settings is a thin integration layer**,
so if you have questions about the 3rd party software used, it's best to use
the support channels for that particular project.

For questions about PasteDeploy,  please use the `paste-users mailing list
<http://groups.google.com/group/paste-users>`_. For questions about Django,
it's best to post questions to `django-users
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-users>`_. Nose has its
`nose-users mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/nose-users>`_ and the
preferred support channel for Buildout is `Python's Distutils-SIG
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/distutils-sig>`_. `Python's Web-SIG
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/web-sig>`_ is the right place for
queries about WSGI in general.

For questions directly related to *django-pastedeploy-settings* or if you're
not sure what's the right place to ask a given question, please use our
`2degrees-floss mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/2degrees-floss/>`_.


Development
===========

We'll only implement the features we're going to use, but if there's something
you're missing, we'd be pleased to apply patches for the features you need, as
long as:

- They are `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and preferably
  `257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ compliant.
- There are unit tests for the new code.
- The new code doesn't break existing functionality.

Please go to `our development site on GitHub
<https://github.com/2degrees/django-pastedeploy-settings/>`_ to get the 
latest code, fork it (and ask us to merge them into ours) and raise
`issues <https://github.com/2degrees/django-pastedeploy-settings/issues/>`_.
