`Paste Deployment <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/>`_ is a widely-used system
which has the sole purpose of enabling developers and sysadmins to configure
WSGI applications (like Django) and WSGI servers.

This project dynamically converts Paste Deployment configuration files to
Django settings, offering a more maintainable way to manage the configuration
of your Django projects.

It's been tested under Python v2.5-2.7 and Django v1.1-1.3. Django v1.4 or
newer isn't yet supported.
