Version 1.0 Beta 1 (2013-06-19)
===============================

This is the first public release.

**django-pastedeploy-settings** started as a fork of `twod.wsgi
<http://pythonhosted.org/twod.wsgi/>`_ v1, with the sole purpose of managing
Django settings as opposed to all the other functionality supported by
*twod.wsgi*. Information about how to migrate from *twod.wsgi* can be found in
:doc:`twodwsgi-migration`.
