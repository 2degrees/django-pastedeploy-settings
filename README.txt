Conversion of Paste Deployment configuration to Django settings
***************************************************************

`Paste Deployment <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/>`_ is a widely-used system
which has the sole purpose of enabling developers and sysadmins to configure
WSGI applications (like Django) and WSGI servers.

This project dynamically converts Paste Deployment configuration files to
Django settings, offering a more maintainable way to manage the configuration
of your Django projects.
